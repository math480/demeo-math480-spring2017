## Church
- In 1929-1932 **Alonzo Church** developed the *$\lambda$-calculus* as a formal system for 
  mathematical logic. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- In 1935 he argued that any function on the natural
  numbers that can be effectively computed, can be
  computed with his calculus. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

## Turing
- In 1935, independently, **Alan Turing** developed what is now
  called the *Turing Machine*. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- In 1936 he too argued that any function on the natural
  numbers can be computed with his machine. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- He also showed the two models are equivalent. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  The equivalence was a powerful indication of the "universality" of <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  the models, and lead to what is now called the: *Church-Turing Thesis* <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
