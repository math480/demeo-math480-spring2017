# First presentation.

Notes for a 5 minute talk answering the following:

1. Why have I chosen math as my major?  
2. What do I love about math?  
3. What is math good for?

## Introduction

Introduce talk and explain that I will address the three questions above.

These are not three separate, independent questions.  

They, and their answers, have complex intereactions.

(Draw triangle.)

             Why love math?
                /   \
               /     \
	          /       \
		     /         \
	Why study _________ What is math
      math?             good for?



**Why math and why am I an nonrecovering math addict?**

+ Survival?  Math is a Darwinian endeavor.

+ Beauty?  a pure and creative endeavor done for its own sake.

+ There is nothing else?


## What is math good for?

I wouldn't say "math is a puzzle." 

But math is the best language for stating and solving problems (the
puzzles) in order to better understand the world and the universe that we
inhabit.

Applications of math touch every part of our lives.  

Applications in 

+ physics, chemistry, and biology, 
+ engineering, finance, and economics, 
+ politics and other social sciences,
+ computing and the limits of computation, 
+ logic, and philosophy,
+_and even math itself.

## Why Study Math?

But why does this make me, or anyone, want to study math?  

Puzzles are fun, but let us think about and try to understand *why* they fun.  

When we solve a difficult problem, where does the feeling of satisfaction come from?  

Do we all have an innate desire to understand the world around us?  
If so, where does this desire come from?

Does everyone yearn to acheive mastery of something that we feel is useful?  
If so, where does this yearning come from?

For me, personally, I don't believe I chose math.  I feel that math chose me.  

I cannot imagine doing anything else with as much passion and interest and
energy and love.  

At a basic level, I think that my addiction to math is a primal instinct.  It is
a pure Darwinian survival mechanism.  I (mostly subconciously, but sometimes conciously) 
feel that what I'm learning and practicing will help me achieve great things.
It will separate me from the pack, make me more valuable to society, a more
desirable employee. 

Perhaps one day I will be faced with a life-or-death sitaution, and my math
skills will come to the rescue and enable me to avert disaster and save the
world... but then maybe I've seen too many movies. 


## Conclusion

## Afterthoughts, comments, questions

"With the shift in Western philosophy from the late 17th Century onwards, German
and British thinkers in particular emphasized beauty as the key component of art
and of the aesthetic experience, and saw art as necessarily aiming at
beauty. For Friedrich Schiller (1759 - 1805), aesthetic appreciation of beauty
is the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts of human
nature. Hegel held that art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit is
immediately manifest to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather than a
subjective revelation of beauty. For Schopenhauer, aesthetic contemplation of
beauty is the most free that the pure intellect can be from the dictates of
will."
