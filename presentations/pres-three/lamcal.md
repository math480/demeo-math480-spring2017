# Lambda Calculus

## Church and Turing

+ In 1929-1932 Church developed the -calculus as a
formal system for mathematical logic.
In 1935 he argued that any function on the natural
numbers that can be effectively computed, can be
computed with his calculus.
In 1935, independently, Turing developed what is now
called the Turing Machine.
In 1936 he too argued that any function on the natural
numbers can be computed with his machine.
He also showed the two models are equivalent.
The equivalence was a powerful indication of the “universality” of
the models, and lead to what is now called the: “Church-Turing
Thesis” (or “Church’s law”)
